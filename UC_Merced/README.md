# University of California, Merced (UC Merced) Coursework Repository

## Overview

This section of the repository features an extensive collection of coursework and projects from various Computer Science and Mathematics courses at the University of California, Merced. It is intended as a reference and study aid for current and prospective students, educators, and researchers who are interested in the academic curricula and pedagogical approaches of UC Merced’s computer science and mathematics programs.

## Course Directory

The coursework is organized by discipline and course number to promote ease of navigation and ensure logical compartmentalization of materials. Within each course directory, you will find lecture notes, assignments, lab exercises, code samples, project documentation, and preparatory materials for examinations. This collection aims to provide a well-rounded learning resource that reflects the theoretical foundations and practical applications taught throughout the UC Merced curriculum.

  A deep dive into algorithmic strategy, complexity theory, and rigorous problem-solving techniques. Topics may include greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and amortized analysis.

- **CSE 106: Exploratory Computing**  
  Hands-on computational experimentation focusing on data manipulation, visualization, and the practical application of computing tools to real-world scenarios.

- **CSE 111: Database Systems**  
  Principles of database design, relational models, structured query languages, transaction management, and distributed database considerations, as well as theory and practice in contemporary database applications.

- **CSE 165: Object-Oriented Programming**  
  Advanced concepts in object-oriented software development, including inheritance, polymorphism, design patterns, and best practices for maintainable, scalable code.

### Mathematics Course

- **MATH 32: Probability and Statistics**  
  Introduction to the foundational concepts of probability theory, random variables, distributions, expected values, hypothesis testing, and statistical inference methods, providing essential mathematical tools for computational work.

## Directory Structure

Each course directory may contain a structured set of materials to guide learners through the curriculum:

- **Lecture Notes & Presentations:** Overviews of theoretical concepts and key ideas covered during the course.
- **Programming Assignments & Solutions:** Source code, problem statements, and example implementations to reinforce hands-on programming proficiency.
- **Lab Exercises:** Practical, guided activities focusing on skill development and conceptual mastery.
- **Project Documentation:** Detailed instructions, sample data sets, and research findings from individual or group projects.
- **Exam Preparation Materials:** Study guides, review questions, and practice problems to assist in assessment readiness.
