    <p>The Fender Stratocaster, colloquially known as the Strat, is a model of electric guitar designed from
        1952
        into 1954 by Leo Fender,
        Bill Carson, George Fullerton and Freddie Tavares. The Fender Musical Instruments Corporation has
        continuously manufactured the Stratocaster
        from 1954 to the present. It is a double-cutaway guitar, with an extended top "horn" shape for balance.
        Along with the Gibson Les Paul, Gibson
        SG and Fender Telecaster, it is one of the most-often emulated electric guitar shapes. "Stratocaster"
        and "Strat" are trademark terms
        belonging to Fender. Guitars that duplicate the Stratocaster by other manufacturers are sometimes called
        S-Type or ST-type guitars.</p>
