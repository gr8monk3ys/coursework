    <p>The Fender Telecaster, colloquially known as the Tele /ˈtɛli/, is the world's first mass-produced,
        commercially successful solid-body electric guitar. Its simple yet effective design and
        revolutionary sound broke ground and set trends in electric guitar manufacturing and popular music.
        Introduced for national distribution as the Broadcaster in the autumn of 1950 as a two-pickup version
        of its sister model, the single-pickup Esquire, the pair were the first guitars of their kind
        manufactured on a substantial scale. A trademark conflict with a rival manufacturer's (Gretsch
        Broadkaster) led to the guitar being renamed in 1951. Initially, the Broadcaster name was simply cut off
        of the labels placed on the guitars (leading to a limited run of nameless guitars known as "No-casters")
        and later in 1951, the final name of Telecaster was applied to the guitar to take advantage of the
        advent of television. The Telecaster quickly became a popular model, and has remained in continuous
        production since its first incarnation.</p>
