    <h1>Les Paul</h1>

    <p>The Gibson Les Paul is a solid body electric guitar that was first sold by the Gibson Guitar Corporation
        in 1952.[1] The guitar was designed by factory manager John Huis and his team with input from and
        endorsement by guitarist Les Paul. Its typical design features a solid mahogany body with a carved maple
        top and a single cutaway, a mahogany set-in neck with a rosewood fretboard, two pickups with independent
        volume and tone controls, and a stoptail bridge, although variants exist.

        The Les Paul was originally offered with a gold finish and two P-90 pickups. In 1957, humbucking pickups
        were added, along with sunburst finishes in 1958. The 1958â€“1960 sunburst Les Paul, today one of the
        best-known electric guitar types in the world, was considered a commercial failure,[citation needed]
        with low production and sales. For 1961, the Les Paul was redesigned into what is now known as the
        Gibson SG. The original single-cutaway, carved top bodystyle was re-introduced in 1968. The Les Paul has
        been produced in many versions and editions since. Along with Fender's Telecaster and Stratocaster, it
        was one of the first mass-produced electric solid-body guitars. Due to their versatility, Les Paul
        electric guitars have been used in a wide range of music genres, including rock, country, pop, soul,
        rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, reggae, punk, and heavy metal.</p>
