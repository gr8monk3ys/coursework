Within each course directory, you will find a range of academic resources—including code examples, project instructions, research reports, and analytical frameworks—tailored to the learning outcomes of each class.

### Computer Science (CSCI) Courses

- **CSCI 572: Information Retrieval and Web Search Engines**  
  Advanced topics in building and analyzing modern search engines, encompassing web crawling, indexing, ranking algorithms, and user-centric evaluation methodologies. Emphasis is placed on understanding how information retrieval techniques adapt to large-scale, dynamic web data and emerging search paradigms.

- **CSCI 585: Database Systems**  
  A deep exploration of relational and non-relational database systems, focusing on database design principles, query processing and optimization, transaction management, and the challenges of distributed data storage. This course provides a strong conceptual and practical foundation in both traditional and cutting-edge database technologies.

### Data Science (DSCI) Courses

- **DSCI 550: Machine Learning for Data Science**  
  Practical machine learning applications in data science, with attention to model selection, feature engineering, and evaluation strategies. Subjects include supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning techniques, and strategies for deploying and scaling machine learning solutions in real-world scenarios.

- **DSCI 551: Foundations of Data Management**  
  Core principles of organizing, modeling, querying, and integrating diverse datasets. Learners investigate big data technologies, data privacy and security considerations, and the use of query languages. The course establishes a comprehensive framework for robust and efficient data management practices.
