%   centroids = COMPUTECENTROIDS(X, idx, K) returns the new centroids by 
%   computing the means of the data points assigned to each centroid. It is
%   given a dataset X where each row is a single data point, a vector
%   idx of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K]) for each
%   example, and K, the number of centroids. You should return a matrix
%   centroids, where each row of centroids is the mean of the data points
%   assigned to it.
%

% Useful variables
[m n] = size(X);

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
centroids = zeros(K, n);


% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Go over every centroid and compute mean of all points that
%               belong to it. Concretely, the row vector centroids(i, :)
%               should contain the mean of the data points assigned to
%               centroid i.
%
% Note: You can use a for-loop over the centroids to compute this.
%

% Loop over each centroid
for k = 1:K
    % Find indices of points assigned to the current centroid
    cluster_points = X(idx == k, :);
    
    % If there are points assigned to this centroid, compute the mean
    if size(cluster_points, 1) > 0
        centroids(k, :) = mean(cluster_points);
    end
    % Otherwise, the centroid will remain at its initialized zero values
end
